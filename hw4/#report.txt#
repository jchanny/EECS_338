	I prefered using the pipe as in #2 because I found that using the POSIX thread method didn't really take advantage of the main benefit of using a pthread, which is shared memory. All that was really needed was the min value found by the other process/thread, and thus using a pipe to send the min value from the other process made more sense to me than creating a new thread and merging its own values into the parent thread.
